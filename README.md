## Hello 👋

Glad to see you here! I am Shreyas and I'm a Software Engineer at Red Hat working in Platform Engineering team. I love playing with software systems, automating things and building platforms that make developers' lives easier. Although I've studied Electronics & Communication Engineering, I'm walking my way along with code, cloud and containers!

I enjoy working with geographically distributed, cross-functional teams at my work. Off the workplace, I am passionate about a lot of things, including travelling, poetry, cricket and performing arts. I am an outspoken and people's person. I like to explore and interact with people from different cultures - and make some friends if we resonate! 🤝
